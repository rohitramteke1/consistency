• Que: Minimum steps to reach 'x' in 2-D column and row wise sorted matrix

• if x is not present then return 0
• else return min number of steps

x = 37
i = 3
j = 3

and it is guaranteed that x will lie on the left side of mat[i][j]
matrix = [
       0   1   2   3      
  0  [10, 20, 30, 40],
  1  [15, 25, 35, 45],
  2  [27, 29, 37, 48],
  3  [30, 35, 40, 50]
